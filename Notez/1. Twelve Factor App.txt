The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications that are designed to be easy to scale and maintain. It is based on 12 principles that are intended to guide the design and development of software applications in order to make them more portable, testable, and scalable. The 12 factors are:

Codebase - One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
Dependencies - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
Config - Store config in the environment
Backing services - Treat backing services as attached resources
Build, release, run - Strictly separate build and run stages
Processes - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
Port binding - Export services via port binding
Concurrency - Scale out via the process model
Disposability - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
Dev/prod parity - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
Logs - Treat logs as event streams
Admin processes - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
These principles are intended to be followed in order to create an app that is easy to deploy, manage, and scale, and that is less prone to errors and downtime.
