### What is Mediator Pattern?
1. The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to communicate with each other without the need for them to know about each other's identities. It promotes loose coupling between objects by providing a mediator object that handles all communication between them. This allows for a more flexible and maintainable system, as changes to the communication between objects can be made by modifying the mediator rather than the objects themselves. Examples of where the Mediator pattern might be useful include GUI frameworks, event systems, and multi-agent systems.

### Where does Mediator Pattern Used in Industry?
1. The Mediator pattern is used in a variety of industries, including software development, system design, and game development.
2. In software development, the Mediator pattern is often used in GUI frameworks to handle communication between different GUI components, such as buttons, text fields, and dialog boxes. By using a mediator to handle communication between these components, the components themselves can be made more reusable and easier to maintain.
3. In system design, the Mediator pattern can be used to design multi-agent systems, such as those used in transportation and logistics, where many agents (e.g. vehicles, warehouses) need to communicate with each other to coordinate their actions. By using a mediator to handle communication between the agents, the system can be made more robust and adaptable to changes.

### How does I Use Mediator Pattern Web Development?
1. In web development, there are some libraries and frameworks that already implement mediator pattern, such as Redux, Vuex, and MobX, which allow to manage state and communication between different parts of the application.

2. Overall, the Mediator pattern can be used in web development to handle communication between different parts of a web application in a decoupled way, making the system more modular and maintainable.

3. Overall, RxJS can be used as an example of the Mediator pattern in web development, as it allows for the creation of reactive and event-based systems where the library itself acts as the mediator, handling communication between different objects, promoting decoupling and maintainability.
