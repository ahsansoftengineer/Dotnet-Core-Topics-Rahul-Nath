### Business Logic Layer

1. In a software application, the business logic layer is the part of the application that contains the business rules and logic that apply to the domain objects. It is responsible for implementing the business logic of the application and ensuring that the rules of the business are enforced.

2. The business logic layer is often implemented as a separate layer in the application architecture, sitting between the presentation layer (e.g., user interface) and the data access layer (e.g., database). This separation of concerns allows the business logic to be reused across different user interfaces and makes it easier to test and maintain the application.

3. The business logic layer may contain a variety of classes and methods, including service classes that implement specific business processes, helper classes that provide utility functions, and validator classes that enforce business rules. It may also interact with the domain layer, which contains the core business concepts and models.

### Domain Layer VS Business Logic Layer
1. In a software application, the domain layer refers to the part of the application that represents the core business concepts and processes. It contains the classes that model the business domain and the rules that govern the behavior of those classes.

2. The business logic layer is the part of the application that contains the business rules and logic that apply to the domain objects. It is responsible for implementing the business logic of the application and ensuring that the rules of the business are enforced.

3. The domain layer and the business logic layer are often used together to represent the business logic of an application. However, they can also be separated into distinct layers, with the domain layer containing the core business concepts and the business logic layer containing the rules and logic that operate on those concepts.
